# FormikForm
This is a basic form using React and Formik with basic validations to check for an email, if its a valid email address, and if there is a password present. If all conditions are present, it will make an alert popup that states "Login Successful!"

# How to Run
1. Clone the repo onto a local machine, make sure you have NodeJS installed
2. cd into the repo in a terminal and type `npm install`
3. Once everything is installed, type `npm start`

If you have issues with the server not starting, create an empty react project with formik installed and replace the node_modules folder
